AwesomeShop
===========

AwesomeShop is a light and fast e-boutique webapp, using modern techniques
to achieve these goals.

AwesomeShop is split in two parts:

* its backend is written in Go
* Its frontend is written in HTML/Javascript/AngularJS (may switch to VueJS)

AwesomeShop is currently being rewritten in Go (instead of Python), as long as
this notice exists in this README file, consider this an unfinished work.
